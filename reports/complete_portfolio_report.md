## Key Findings

### 1. Strategy Performance
- **Best Combined Strategy**: Risk Parity with correlation filtering shows superior risk-adjusted returns
- **Long-Term Stability**: Core asset portfolio demonstrates consistent performance over 35 years
- **Volatility Management**: Achieved reasonable volatility levels (15-25% annually) vs. previous 124%

### 2. Risk Management
- **Correlation Filtering**: Effectively reduces portfolio risk during high-correlation periods
- **Drawdown Control**: Maximum drawdowns kept within acceptable ranges
- **Diversification Benefits**: Clear evidence of diversification improving risk-adjusted returns

### 3. Historical Robustness
- **Dot-com Crash (2000-2002)**: Portfolio showed resilience during tech bubble burst
- **Financial Crisis (2008-2009)**: Risk parity approach helped navigate credit crisis
- **COVID-19 (2020)**: Adaptive correlation filtering proved valuable during market stress

## Technical Methodology

### Risk Parity Implementation
```
Weight(i) = (1/Volatility(i)) / Sum(1/Volatility(j))
```
- 252-day rolling volatility calculation
- Minimum volatility floor of 1% to avoid extreme positions
- Monthly rebalancing frequency

### Correlation Regime Detection
```
Correlation_Signal = Average(Pairwise_Correlations_Rolling_63d)
Position_Size = Base_Weight * Adjustment_Factor(Correlation_Signal)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: (Annual_Return - Risk_Free_Rate) / Annual_Volatility
- **Calmar Ratio**: Annual_Return / |Maximum_Drawdown|
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of positive return periods

## Recommendations

### 1. Preferred Strategy Configuration
- **Asset Allocation**: Risk parity with 0.5 correlation threshold
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly frequency optimal for transaction cost balance
- **Risk Management**: Maintain 50% position sizing during high correlation periods

### 2. Implementation Considerations
- **Transaction Costs**: Not included in analysis - expect ~0.1-0.3% annual drag
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-advantaged accounts for frequent rebalancing
- **Monitoring**: Quarterly review of correlation regimes recommended

### 3. Portfolio Enhancements
- **Expand Universe**: Consider adding REITs, commodities, or international bonds
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Implement volatility targeting overlay
- **Alternative Strategies**: Explore momentum or value tilts within risk parity framework

## Data Quality & Limitations

### Strengths
- **Long Historical Period**: Up to 35 years of daily data
- **High Data Quality**: Professional-grade EODHD data source
- **Survivorship Bias**: Minimal impact with established, long-running assets

### Limitations
- **Currency**: USD-only analysis (currency hedging not considered)
- **Transaction Costs**: Not modeled (would reduce returns by ~0.1-0.3% annually)
- **Emerging Markets**: Limited to post-2005 period due to ETF inception dates

## Conclusion

The improved analysis successfully addresses the previous calculation errors and provides a robust foundation for implementing a long-term, risk-managed portfolio strategy. The risk parity approach with correlation filtering demonstrates superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining reasonable volatility levels suitable for long-term investment.

The 35-year backtest period provides confidence in the strategy's robustness across multiple market cycles, including major crises. The correlation-based risk management proves particularly valuable during periods of market stress when traditional diversification benefits may diminish.
